Sasha is a FIRST FRC competition robot that was converted over to a Raspberry Pi based control system.  Sasha was initially designed to throw frisbees and later had pneumatic T-shirt cannons added.  The original Texas Instruments Jaguar motor controllers and some Spike relays drive motors and solenoids.  A Pololu Maestro servo controller sends PWM signals to the motor controllers, a custom Pi hat runs the Spike relays and interfaces with limit switches, and an XBox 360 controller is used for driving, aiming and shooting.  See these repositiories for more details into the hardware and associated Python classes.

Setting up a Raspberry Pi based bot is actually quite simple.  Check out [PiBot](https://github.com/FRC4564/BasicPiBot) for details on getting started.
